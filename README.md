## 🧩 Business Problem

Blinkit, a leading quick-commerce grocery delivery platform, manages a wide variety of products across different outlet types, locations, and establishment years.  
However, the company is facing challenges such as:

- Unclear visibility of **which outlet types generate the most sales**  
- Lack of insights on **customer preferences (Fat Content, Item Type, Item Weight)**  
- No consolidated view of **ratings, outlet size performance, and category-wise sales**  
- Difficulty in identifying **high-performing vs low-performing product segments**  
- Absence of a unified dashboard for **leadership decision-making**

### Objective

To build an **Excel-based analytical dashboard** that helps Blinkit answer:

- Which items and outlet types contribute most to total revenue?
- How do sales vary across different outlet sizes, locations, and item types?
- Are healthier product categories (Low Fat) more popular?
- Which factors influence average ratings?
- How can Blinkit optimize product availability and outlet performance?

The goal is to enable **data-driven decisions** for improving sales, customer satisfaction, and outlet efficiency.
